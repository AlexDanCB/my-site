      <h1 class="myrules">My Rules</h1>

    <div class="rules rule1">
      <h3>Base-lines</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>1. What is important in an app or web is its usefulness (if the distribution of the elements is correct and intuitive…), after that, “think pretty”.</li>
        <li>2. If you have the correct information you are able to redesign almost everything</li>
        <li>3. As much as you want to imagine what your audience needs, rather than imagine, it is best to ask.</li>
        <li>4. Work hard, keep one eye on every detail and every aspect of the consecutive tasks while your other eye is into build the project.</li>
        <li>5. Manage to not only synchronised your work-methods with the rest of the team but to share knowledge, laughs and a good time.</li>
        <li>6. It’s pure luck that you get to be part of a good team ‘🎲’.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
<br>

    <div class="rules rule2">
      <h3>Into the project</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>7. Get rid of everything that does not work for users and business. Even if the data, the users themselves and the market back the design.</li>
        <li>8. Put the same passion when you create that when you destroy. Once the prototype is finished, it’s time to spend the same time criticising it, removing what is left and being honest with what is missing.</li>
        <li>9. Love your designs like your “summer love”, intensely but for a short time, never forgetting but always moving on.</li>
        <li>10. When you are designing an experience based on users needs and expectations, or based in a solid business process, you feel like you are doing the right thing, you don’t feel like you will fail, but yes, you will. The falling rule
          (-not
          failing- because you are not really failing, you are just falling a little) will be applied always. Cool, right? 🧑🏻‍🎤 Knowing this, will help you when you feel hurt and when you would like to see the huge horizon of possibilities and
          ways to prove yourself as a team member and as an individual designer.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <br>


    <div class="rules rule3">
      <h3>Into decisions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>11. Risks only worth it if the full team are ok with them. If someone is not ok with taking risks, is time to convince or to understand. Consensus.</li>
        <li>12. There is no use of jumping into the abyss if someone on the team is not convinced to jump. Once the changes and decisions are already on the table, it´s the moment of being sure about being ready and excited about continuing. If it´s
          a
          no, time for solid arguments and deep talking.</li>
        <li>13. If you don´t believe in what you created as a team, you won´t be able to defend it. How would you be able to honour the time and work invested in a project if you are not sure about the decisions taken? Better to build a previous
          consensus and be sure of decisions and risks before jumping. After all, it is no use having risked and succeeded if someone on the team was not convinced to do it.</li>
        <li>14. The real victory is not receiving everyone’s applause and thumbs up; the real victory is to create a project where everyone on the team contributed and where everyone was convinced to follow through on those decisions.</li>
